\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
This is a guide to the statistically best way to play the game of Yahtzee. This is not a rule book or an istruction manual, so it will asume that you already know the rules of the game. I will try to focus on those aspects of optimal play that are not obvious.  I will try to ensure that any advice of strategy I give is the statistical best, and I will calculate all probablilities using computer simulations. This is because mathemetically calculating probablilities for the game of Yahtzee is not trivial, and I am no expert on game theory. Additionaly, simulating turns of Yahtzee and random rolls gives a satisfactory degree of precision. The same holds true for strategies that are not obvious. I will test and compare different strategies using simulations. The source code for all simulations used can be found in the git repository linked at the end of this document.
